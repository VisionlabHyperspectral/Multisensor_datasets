# A Multisensor Hyperspectral Benchmark Dataset For Unmixing of Intimate Mixtures 

In this work, we generated a comprehensive hyperspectral dataset of intimate mineral powder mixtures by homogeneously
mixing five different clay powders (Kaolin, Roof clay, Red clay, mixed clay, and Calcium hydroxide). We generated a 
total of 325 mixtures by mixing these five pure clay powders. All possible clay combinations of these powders were 
considered, i.e., 10 binary combinations, 10 ternary combinations, 5 quaternary combinations, and one quinary combination.
